# Python_Django_Postgre_Website
I created my virtual environement and activate it
I piped Django 
I used Python/Django in the back end. At first i started a new django project.After that, I added application "courses" and the model "Course".
I created a database in PostgreSQL in the name "learningdb" and in the settings.py i related it to my Django project.
I also maked the static ROOT, static URL for my static file and used the command Collectstatic. Same done for media.
I added routes, views and templates with bootstrap
I used the "context" in the views in order to send data from views to template
Finally i pushed my project in my gitHub repositories
